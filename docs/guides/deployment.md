# Deployment

How component-auth is deployed. The service is a **stateless container** driven entirely by environment
variables, with **MongoDB** as its only persistent dependency. It can run anywhere Docker runs; the
default pattern is a **manual deploy over SSH to a Docker host**.

## Prerequisites on the host

- **Docker** with Compose v2.
- A reachable **MongoDB** (provisioned by the compose stack, or external — set `MONGO_URI`).
- An **external Docker network** the service attaches to, if you front it with a shared reverse proxy
  (create it once: `docker network create <network-name>`; reference it from the compose overlay).
- A **public HTTPS endpoint** (reverse proxy, ingress, or tunnel) terminating TLS in front of the
  service. HTTPS is required both for Google's OAuth redirect URI and for any consumer's verifier
  configuration (issuer + JWKS URL). The service itself listens on `PORT` (default `7305`).

## Secrets

Secrets live in a **gitignored `docker/.env`** and are **never committed**:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` — the Google OIDC app (service-level, not per tenant).
- `OAUTH_KEY_PASSPHRASE` — optional AES-256-GCM encryption of signing keys at rest.
- `AUTH_JWT_ISSUER` — the public HTTPS issuer URL; becomes the token `iss`.
- `MONGO_URI` and the rest of the knobs documented in `service/.env.example`.

Build context (`../service`) and `${VAR}` interpolation resolve **locally** before the build is sent to
the remote daemon, so the gitignored `docker/.env` never leaves the operator's machine.

## Deploy

Run Compose against a remote Docker daemon over SSH by pointing `DOCKER_HOST` at the target host:

```bash
# Deploy from a workstation against the remote daemon over SSH
export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://<deploy-host>

# Dev overlay
docker compose --env-file docker/.env \
  -f docker/compose.yaml -f docker/compose.dev.yaml up -d --build
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml -f docker/compose.dev.yaml ps

# Production overlay: swap compose.dev.yaml → compose.prod.yaml
```

The image build runs `npm run build && npm test`, so a type error or a red test **fails the deploy**.

## CI-driven deploys (ds1)

The default ds1 deploy is **automatic** (`.github/workflows/deploy-ds1.yml`), mirroring the other fps4
stacks: a green **Definition of Done** on `main` chains into `deploy-ds1`, which runs on the shared
`[self-hosted, ds1]` runner and drives the host Docker daemon over the mounted socket — `compose build`
+ `up -d`, then gates on the service's `/health` healthcheck via `docker inspect` (the runner has no
host-port access). `workflow_dispatch` runs it on demand.

- **Config:** the non-secret base is committed at `config/ds1/.env.base`; the workflow assembles
  `config/ds1/.env` (base + Actions secrets) runner-local and deletes it afterwards.
- **Secrets** (repo Actions secrets, appended only when set — the ds1 SMOKE posture runs without them):
  `OAUTH_KEY_PASSPHRASE`, and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` / `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`.
- **Seeding stays manual** (RQ-0004): the pipeline ships the service; provisioning tenants/clients/users
  (`npm run seed`) remains an operator step — see *Seed & recovery* below.

The SSH / `DOCKER_HOST` runbook above still works for a laptop-driven deploy or a host without the runner.

## Seed & recovery (identity data) — ADR-0006 / RQ-0006

The auth data (tenants, app clients, users) lives in MongoDB. Its **definition is committed** at
`config/seed.yaml` (only `${ENV}` secret references — no plaintext), and the secret **values** live as
**GitHub Actions secrets** — the durable, off-host fallback. The deploy keeps the mongo data volume, so
steady-state data is not wiped; re-seed only for first setup, a new tenant/client, or after a loss.

**Required secrets** (set as repo/Environment Actions secrets, and export into the environment to seed):

| Secret env var | What |
| --- | --- |
| `SEED_DEMO_PASSWORD`, `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `demo` tenant users |
| `SEED_SOVEREIGN_COPILOT_DEMO_PASSWORD`, `SEED_SOVEREIGN_COPILOT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `sovereign-copilot` users |
| `SEED_MAESTRO_PO_PASSWORD`, `SEED_MAESTRO_SA_PASSWORD`, `SEED_MAESTRO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `maestro` users |
| `MAESTRO_GATEWAY_DS1_SECRET` | `sovereign-llm-gateway-ds1` runtime client secret — **must equal** the gateway repo's `MAESTRO_RUNTIME_CLIENT_SECRET` (US-0086) |
| `MAESTRO_COPILOT_DS1_SECRET` | `sovereign-copilot-ds1` runtime client secret — **must equal** the copilot repo's `MAESTRO_RUNTIME_CLIENT_SECRET` |

**Recover / re-seed** (from `service/`, against ds1's Mongo on its published port `27019`):

```bash
SEED_DEMO_PASSWORD=… SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD=… \
SEED_SOVEREIGN_COPILOT_DEMO_PASSWORD=… SEED_SOVEREIGN_COPILOT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=… \
SEED_MAESTRO_PO_PASSWORD=… SEED_MAESTRO_SA_PASSWORD=… SEED_MAESTRO_ADMIN_PASSWORD=… \
MAESTRO_GATEWAY_DS1_SECRET=… MAESTRO_COPILOT_DS1_SECRET=… \
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27019 MONGO_DB_NAME=component-auth \
  npm run seed
```

Idempotent: tenants/clients are upserted; **existing users are left untouched** — change a password with
`npm run manage-users -- set-password --tenant=<id> --email=<e> --password=<p>`. Passwords are stored as
scrypt hashes; the plaintext lives only in the Actions secret and with the human owner.

## Verify

- `GET /health` returns `{ "status": "ok" }`.
- `GET /.well-known/jwks.json` serves the RS256 public keys consumers verify against.
- A consumer's verifier env (`*_ISSUER` / `*_AUDIENCE` / `*_JWKS_URL`) must line up **exactly** with
  what this service mints — see [`tenant-config.md`](./tenant-config.md).
