## Context

[RQ-0001](../requirements/RQ-0001-workspace-user-identity-google-sso.md) deliberately kept **UI out of
component-auth**: it ships backend flows + a headless TypeScript SDK, and "the consumer's login UI"
was out of scope (maestro's ADR-0019 puts the login screen in the consumer). That holds for maestro,
which builds its own surface.

But a second consumer — **sovereign-copilot** — needs a login screen and would rather **reuse** one
than hand-roll it (its auth is a planned `core-6` slice; today it runs on a hardcoded user). The
architect chose: ship a **reusable React `<Login/>` component from component-auth** so consumers drop
it in rather than each rebuilding the form.

This reverses the "auth service stays UI-free" stance, so it is recorded here. The risk to avoid is
forcing a React dependency onto **server-side** SDK consumers (the client-credentials grant runs in
Node with no React), or coupling the component to one app's design system.

## Decision

**Ship the React UI as a separate, opt-in package — `@fps4/component-auth-react` — not by adding React
to the headless `@fps4/component-auth` SDK.**

- The new `react/` package exports a drop-in `<Login/>` (email/password against the local IdP,
  RQ-0002) plus the underlying `requestPasswordToken` function for custom UIs.
- **React is a peer dependency**; the package is otherwise self-contained (it calls component-auth's
  HTTP API directly, not via the SDK), so a consumer adds exactly one dependency it doesn't already
  have. The headless SDK is untouched — server-side consumers never transitively pull in React.
- The component is **styling-agnostic**: neutral inline defaults so it works with zero CSS, every
  element takes a `className`, and `unstyled` drops the inline styles for Tailwind/shadcn consumers.
- It is a **login form, not a session manager**: it returns the issued token via `onSuccess`. Token
  storage, route guarding, and refresh stay the host app's responsibility.

### Why not the alternatives

- **Add React to `@fps4/component-auth`.** Simplest to find, but pollutes the headless SDK with a
  React (peer) dependency and JSX build for every consumer, including Node-only ones. Rejected.
- **Build the screen only in sovereign-copilot.** Fine for one app, but the architect explicitly
  wanted reuse across consumers. A shared package pays off as more surfaces appear.
- **A full session/provider kit** (`<AuthProvider>`, route guards, auto-refresh). More than asked
  for and more opinionated about app architecture; deferred. The component returns the token and gets
  out of the way; a richer kit can layer on later without breaking this.

## Consequences

- **component-auth now ships UI**, in a clearly-separated optional package. The default still holds:
  the SDK and service are UI-free; React is opt-in.
- **A new build/test target** (`react/`) joins the DoD CI alongside `service` and `sdk`.
- **Google SSO via the component** is a natural follow-up (a "Sign in with Google" affordance over
  the existing redirect helpers); only the password method ships now (RQ-0003 scope).
- **Session concerns remain the host's** — documented, not hidden. If repetition across consumers
  proves it worthwhile, a provider/guard kit is the additive next step.
